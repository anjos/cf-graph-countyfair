These are solutions that have withstood the test of time with respect to re-usability, flexibility, and maintainability. 'R6P' provides abstract base classes with examples for a few known design patterns. The patterns were selected by their applicability to analytic projects in R. Using these patterns in R projects have proven effective in dealing with the complexity that data-driven applications possess."
