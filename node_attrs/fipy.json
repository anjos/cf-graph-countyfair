Our approach, combining\nthe FV method and Python, provides a tool that is extensible, powerful\nand freely available. A significant advantage to Python is the existing\nsuite of tools for array calculations, sparse matrices and data\nrendering.\n|\nThe FiPy framework includes terms for transient diffusion, convection\nand standard sources, enabling the solution of arbitrary combinations\nof coupled elliptic, hyperbolic and parabolic PDEs.
