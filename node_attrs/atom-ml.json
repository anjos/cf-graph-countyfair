   "description": "There is no magic formula in data science that can tell us which type of\nmachine learning algorithm will perform best for a specific use-case.\nDifferent models are better suited for different types of data and\ndifferent problems. At best, you can follow some rough guide\non how to approach problems with regard to which model to try on your\ndata, but these are often more confusing than helpful. Best practices\ntell us to start with a simple model (e.g. linear regression) and build\nup to more complicated models (e.g. linear regression -> random forest\n-> multi-layer perceptron) if you are not satisfied with the results.\nUnfortunately, different models require different data cleaning steps,\ndifferent type/amount of features, tuning a new set of hyperparameters,\netc. Refactoring the code for this purpose can be quite boring and\ntime-consuming. Because of this, many data scientists end up just using\nthe model best known to them and fine-tuning this particular model\nwithout ever trying different ones. This can result in poor performance\n(because the model is just not the right one for the task) or in poor\ntime management (because you could have achieved a similar performance\nwith a simpler/faster model).\n\nATOM is made to help you solve these issues. With just a few lines of code,\nyou can perform basic data cleaning steps, select relevant features and\ncompare the performance of multiple models on a given dataset. ATOM should\nbe able to provide quick insights on which algorithms perform best for the\ntask at hand and provide an indication of the feasibility of the ML solution.\n\nIt is important to realize that ATOM is not here to replace all the work a\ndata scientist has to do before getting his model into production. ATOM\ndoesn't spit out production-ready models just by tuning some parameters in\nits API. After helping you to determine the right model, you will most\nprobably need to fine-tune it using use-case specific features and data\ncleaning steps in order to achieve maximum performance.\n\nSo, this sounds a bit like AutoML, how is ATOM different than\nauto-sklearn or TPOT? Well, ATOM does AutoML in\nthe sense that it helps you find the best model for a specific task, but\ncontrary to the aforementioned packages, it does not actively search for\nthe best model. It simply runs all of them and let you pick the one that\nyou think suites the task best. AutoML packages are often black boxes: if\nyou provide data, it will magically return a working model. Although it\nworks great, they often produce complicated pipelines with low explainability.\nThis is hard to sell to the business. In this, ATOM excels.
