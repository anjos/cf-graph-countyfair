  "about": {
   "description": "CLI11 provides all the features you expect in a powerful command line\nparser, with a beautiful, minimal syntax and no dependencies beyond\nC++11. It is header only, and comes in a single file form for easy\ninclusion in projects. It is easy to use for small projects, but\npowerful enough for complex command line projects, and can be\ncustomized for frameworks. It is tested on Travis, AppVeyor, Azure,\nand GitHub Actions, and is used by the GooFit GPU fitting framework.\nIt was inspired by plumbum.cli for Python. CLI11 has a user friendly\nintroduction in this README, a more in-depth tutorial GitBook, as well\nas API documentation generated by Travis. See the changelog or GitHub\nReleases for details for current and past releases. Also see the\nVersion 1.0 post, Version 1.3 post, or Version 1.6 post for more\ninformation.\n",
